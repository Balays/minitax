indir	/mnt/d/Gemini/Microbacontrol/20221110_microbacontrol_v1_v2/fastq	minimap2	absolute path to directory of fastq files
outdir	NA	both	will be composed from platform, db, and project arguments, this will be the output directory (will be created and files here will be ovrewritten)
debug	FALSE	both	if there was a problem, try to show in which step
mm2_path	/mnt/d/ubuntu/programs/mm2-fast/minimap2	minimap2	absolute path of minimap2
mm2_index	all_NCBI_genomes.idx	minimap2	filename of minimap2 index, relative to db.dir
mm2_ref	NA	minimap2	filename of minimap2 reference database (.fasta), if there's no index yet (relative to db.dir)
fastq_pair_pattern	_L001	minimap2	In case of Illumina paired-end seq what is the common pattern for the pairs? Usually it is L0001, and what is after 
fastq_suffix	_001.fastq.gz	minimap2	extension of fastq files

misc.dir	/mnt/e/my.R.packages/Rlyeh-main	minitax	absolute path of minitax home directory
metadata	metadata.tsv	minitax	tab-separated metadata file, the 'sample' coulmn should be the same as the the bamfiles (without the 'pattern' argumetn, i.e. file suffix)
keep.highest.mapq.aln.only	T	minitax	in case of multi-mapping reads, keep the one with the highest MAPQ value only
crop.na.tax	F	minitax	???
multicore	T	minitax	Run minitax in multicore?
saveRAM	F	minitax	Frequently save intermediate files and load them back in, or be as fast as possible?
mapq.filt	NA	minitax	If other than NA, filter out alignments with MAPQ values lower than this
outputs	bam.sum, alignments_w_taxa, best_alignments_w_taxa, sum_taxa, sum_LCA_taxa		
methods	BestAln;SpeciesEstimate	minitax	
pardir	NA	minitax	directory of bamfiles
pattern	.bam	minitax	pattern of bamfiles (for subseting)
CIGAR_points	match_score = 1; mismatch_score = -3; insertion_score = -2; deletion_score = -2; gap_opening_penalty = -2; gap_extension_penalty = -1	minitax	rules for scoring the alignments
best.mapq	T	minitax find the alignment with the highest mapq for each read before analysing CIGAR scores
